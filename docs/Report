**i. Which insights did you gain from your EDA?**

 Fraudulent transactions are high-amount, time-clustered (mostly after step 400), "C" accounts, and type-specific (TRANSFER and CASH_OUT). The current flagging system isFlaggedFraud is overly conservative (amount > 200,000), missing >99% of fraud. They often drain the origin account’s balance, with transaction amounts inversely related to the destination account’s pre-transaction balance.


**ii. How did you determine which columns to drop or keep? If your EDA informed this process, explain which insights you used to determine which columns were not needed.**

I dropped the name columns since they are unique ids. I also dropped the naive model "isFlaggedFraud". To reduce multicollinearity, I removed the newbalance variables based on the correlation matrix insights. 

**iii. Which hyperparameter tuning strategy did you use? Grid-search or random-search? Why?**

I focused on random-search since it is a faster strategy for a larger dataset. I was able to do Grid-search for Naive Bayes but it produced the same result as random-search. 

**iv. How did your model's performance change after discovering optimal hyperparameters?** 

**v. What was your final F1 Score?**
